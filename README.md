## Under development, please use `bookingbot.py` for now if on Windows, and `BookingBotApp.pyw` for macOS and Linux

### Prerequisites

- You will need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed on your device. This program will not work without it.

- You must have latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your device.

- You must download `BookingBotApp.pyw`, if you are on Windows, download `bookingbot.py` instead.

- Once installed, run the program by opening `BookingBot.pyw` or (optional dependency: `bookingbot.py`) using `Python Launcher`.

- Make sure you have DUO Push set up with your phone.

- Fill out infos, and then run the program.

### When running

- If using UBCO wifi, you will not need to send a DUO push. If not, you will need to send a DUO push.

- If you choose not to enter the right credentials, the script will not work and will ask you to rerun the program. Once you enter the right credentials, the program will save your credentials in `data.rin` and automatically run in headless mode and log you on for the next time.
